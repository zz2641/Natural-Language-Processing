# Natural Language Processing
![](rsm-tmt-nlp.jpg)
The use of natural language processing has exploded over the last decade. Appilcations that require machines to understand natural human speech patterns are abundant and substantial improvements in these systems has increased their utility. Within the educational space NLP is used to interpret human speech for the prupose of understanding human problems and recently an online tutor passed a limited version of the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) when it was [indistinguishable from teaching assistants in a college class](http://www.news.gatech.edu/2017/01/09/jill-watson-round-three).

## Goals for this unit

* Understand and apply the basic process of natural language proceessing and the role of pre-processing text
* Understand and apply a sentiment analysis to a set of documents
* Understand and apply a latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) to a set of documents

## Tasks for this unit

In this unit you will completing three main tasks. Processing a set of documents, running a sentiment analysis of thise documents and then generating topic models of those documents. The documents we will be using will be student notes that the class HUDK4050 made last semester. As background to this task please read over the follwing materials and watch the methodological videos. If you find any other useful materials please add them under Additional Materials at the end of the this page and pull request the change back to this repo.
